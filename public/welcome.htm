        Today you will be participating in a social learning task. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by playing with
        other players live. You will only be paid if you finish the entire task (game plus survey). If you fail to make a
        move in some of the rounds (e.g., because you run out of time) points will be deducted from your score, so pay attention.
        At the end of the game, every
        <u>1,000</u> points will be converted to
        <u>$1.00</u> in payoff.
